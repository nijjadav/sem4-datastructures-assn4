# sem4-datastructures-assn4
Assignment 4 of Semester Four's Data Structures class, written in C

This assignment illustrates my coding tendancies even when under time-pressure to quickly get an assignment done:
- I always like to use descriptive variable and function names
- I always use comments to mark out each "section" of code within a function, and comments to describe what each function does

I coded this project using Dev-C++ . It generated a Makefile, though I never directly used it.
